Features

  Menu: The coffee machine offers three options: espresso, latte, and cappuccino. Each option has its own set of ingredients and cost.

  Payment: Users can pay for their drink by inserting quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. The program calculates the total amount inserted and provides change if needed.

  Resources Report: Users can request a report on the current resources available in the coffee machine, including water, milk, coffee, and money.

  Shut Down: Users can shut down the coffee machine by entering "off" at the drink selection prompt.

Maintenance

  Refilling Resources: If the coffee machine runs out of any ingredient (water, milk, or coffee), it will notify the user and refuse to make the selected drink until the resource is refilled.

  Emptying the Money Container: Users can check the amount of money collected in the machine by requesting a report.

  Powering Off: To shut down the coffee machine, enter "off" at the drink selection prompt. This will terminate the program.
